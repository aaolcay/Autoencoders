## Autoencoders
In this repository, different autoencoder applications are published with introductions for readers or researchers to understand the major concepts. The good thing, here on this repository, is that everything was made easy for someone who just started studying Deep Learning algorithms. We would insert all things into the bunch of class but thought that it might have made some troublesome for comprehension. Therefore, we just gave all the things in our codes line by line.

We updated the python code that you can see in 'autoencoder_updated.ipynb' so that we can include how to save and load a model built for using similar tasks in different problems (i.e., transfer learning). We also compared both original data and autoencoded data.
